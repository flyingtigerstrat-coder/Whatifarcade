# DESIGN — IRONLINE
**Design notes for `games/ironline/`. Read with the repo-root `CLAUDE.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, and the game's `CLAUDE.md`/`BRIEF.md`. The code in `battle-train-hd.html` is always the source of truth; this documents the why.**

## Depth bands — the staging ladder

The scene is composed in **depth bands**, far-to-near then on top. This is **descriptive**: `draw()` already runs in this order — the ladder just gives every drawable a declared home so the picture stays legible as it grows. A side-on train owns the middle of the frame, so anything at its depth *behind* it is occluded; the bands keep each thing where it reads.

| # | Band | What lives here (in `draw()` order) |
|---|------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Sky** | sky gradient (`dnTop/dnMid/dnHor`), sun/moon glow, stars, drifting clouds, vultures |
| 2 | **Far parallax** | most-distant landform ranges + far biome silhouettes, fading into the horizon **haze** (aerial perspective) |
| 3 | **Mid parallax / ground** | mid-biome landmarks, the ground plane + texture, cracks, debris, story props, foreground wrecks, ambient life |
| 4 | **Back rail + traffic** | the **far rail** (`lane(110)`), passing **NPC trains** (traders / raider convoys), and **set-back station architecture** — haze-dimmed so it reads as *behind* |
| 5 | **Player rail + the rig** | the **middle rail** (`lane(138)`) and the **train**. The rig owns this band **alone** — a clean, unbroken silhouette |
| 6 | **Front rail + foreground** | the **near rail** (`lane(166)`), the **station platform + people**, foreground props (tumbleweed) — *in front of* the rig |
| 7 | **FX / combat** | raiders, boss, salvage crate, tracers, muzzle flash, explosions; the engine's smoke rides with the rig |
| 8 | **Atmosphere** | the full-frame grade (`drawOverlays`): rust wash, night tint, vignette, drifting grain, weather — lights and unifies everything below |
| 9 | **UI** | place-name banner, region label, pan-hint chevrons, journey progress bar — legible regardless of how the world is composed |

**The one rule (enforce going forward):** *a new drawable names its band before it's drawn.* If you can't say which band something belongs to, the composition isn't decided yet.

**Why it matters — the pass/fail test for any station/depot scene:** trace the train's outline. If you can't get around it without hitting a station part, the bands are collapsed (something behind-the-train is being drawn at the train's own depth). The fix is always the same: push it up-and-back into band 4 (haze-dimmed), drop it to the band-6 foreground strip, or promote it to the band-9 UI — never leave it on band 5 with the rig.

### Worked example — THE RAILHEAD (the origin depot)
- **Band 4:** the **station** (clock-cupola anchor) + water tower, silo, signal mast — beside the rail, planted on the far rail, haze-dimmed. No over-rail structures (a full-width canopy/gantry cages the rig — retired; the only awning is a small doorway canopy on the station itself).
- **Band 5:** the rig, docked, alone on its rail.
- **Band 6:** the plank platform + the Dispatcher + a kid + a worker + a lantern — a thin foreground strip.
- **Band 9:** "THE RAILHEAD" as a top-of-frame banner (off the rail; scales to every future depot).

> Reference note (Tiny Rails): borrowed for **spatial grammar only** — depth bands, train-alone-on-its-rail, place-name as a UI banner. **Not** its palette or mood; IRONLINE stays dusk + rust and never brightens toward the reference.

## Buildings — the structure grammar

Station/depot structures are **entities, not one-off blobs**: a list (`RH_BUILDINGS`) of building entities, each drawn by a **recipe** (`bStation`, `bWaterTower`, `bDepot`, `bSilo`, `bSignal`, …) **composed of shared parts** (`bWall`, `bGable`/`bHip` roofs, `bWindow` (height-aware), `bDoor`, `bAwning`, `bBay`, `bClock`, `bPipe`, `bLadder`, `bBraceX`, `bFoot`). Scale reads through the recipe: a `bDepot` is a one-room cabin (a small stop); a `bStation` is the railhead's anchor — taller hip-roofed massing, a **clock cupola**, a row of tall windows, a double-door with an entrance canopy, and a station-master **ticket bay**. Build a new structure by writing a recipe from the parts and adding an entry — not by hand-placing rectangles. (Same engine/recipe split as the art pipeline: parts are the *how*, recipes are the *what*.)

**The realism principles every recipe follows** (so structures read as built things, not flat slabs):
1. **Silhouette first** — a varied, readable outline (a pitched/stepped roof, a tank, a mast), never a plain box.
2. **Structural logic** — it looks load-bearing: **footed** (`bFoot` — a stone footing + contact shadow where it meets the ground), with legs, **cross-braces** (`bBraceX`), beams, and lintels that carry weight.
3. **Volume** — front face + a thin **right shadow-plane** so it reads 3D; roofs get an **overhang + eave shadow**.
4. **One light direction** — top-lit (lit top/left edges, shadowed right/under), consistent with the train's material language.
5. **Material language (locked)** — two-metal + rust: `BWOOD` (weathered plank), `BIRON` (rust iron), `BSTL` (gunmetal). 5-value ramps, hard AO seams, rust streaks + patches.
6. **Weathering & asymmetry** — streaks under bolts, patched panels, scavenged add-ons (the depot's lean-to annex); nothing grid-perfect — the wonk sells it.
7. **Function reads** — water tower = tank + bands + fill-spout + gauge; depot = door + lit windows + stovepipe; silo = corrugation + outlet; signal = ladder + hooded lamps. You can tell what each one *does*.
8. **Cluster, don't scatter** — a depot is a *place*: a few structures of varied scale (the depot building anchors; tower / silo / signal are secondary), spaced so each reads.

All depot buildings live in **band 4**: footed on `RHGY` (the far rail), rising into the backdrop, then **haze-dimmed** by the aerial-perspective veil so the cluster recedes behind the train. Adding a new depot type = new recipes + a new entity list; the bands and the veil come for free.
